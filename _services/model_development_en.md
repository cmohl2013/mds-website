* deep learning
* supervised classification
* unsupervised classification (clustering)
* regression

* development of prototypes
* development of production models

#### My working principles:

* As simple as possible, as complicated as necessary: Your data-driven predictive models will be perfectly tailored to data situations and business problems.

* Robust Data Science solutions require a solid foundation: design and optimization of predictive models are done with scientifically sound methods.

* Quality through high engineering standards: Code is documented in detail, and comprehensive unit tests ensure robust functionality.
