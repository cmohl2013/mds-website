  description: Development of a machine learning application for the analysis of sensor data.
  description_long: >
    Highly noisy time series data are recorded via a sensor within a measuring apparatus.
    In these time series, sporadically occurring events are to be automatically detected and characterized.
    For this purpose, a machine learning software with MVC architecture was implemented in Python.
    The software includes the following functionality:
    Filter and normalize the raw data, calculate robust metrics based on the pre-processed data,
    provide a graphical user interface to display data and interactively create training data sets, 
    automatic detection of events using a supervised machine learning method, export of the result data.

  description: Automated characterization of tissue samples using deep learning
  description_long : As part of a medical research project, tissue samples were photographed with an automated microscope. Based on Python and Tensorflow, software was developed to identify and classify specific cell types in the tissue. In this way, different cell types could be counted automatically for user-defined tissue regions.
